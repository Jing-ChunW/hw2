first part is to set the freq and show on the screen, 
use the method of Lab5 to control the output of LCD, 
and use Analogin to get the button signal to control the information show on the screen.

then we need to create a specific triangle waveform, take it as input of RC filter, 
I divide it into two part, one is go up from 0 to 3, the other is from 3 to 0.
After we create a input triangle waveform, we can get a output result.
Use picoscope to get the waveform.
Finally, using analogin to read the signal, then sampling it, and compare the result of original one and the one doing FFT.
in FFT.py
It is the process of doing FFT.
